# USSD Menu Simulation - Collaborative Lab

## Overview
This is a **collaborative Python lab project** to simulate a USSD menu system for a fictional telecom provider.  
The project is designed for **4 groups** to work on different parts of the program using GitHub.

## USSD Menu Options

1. **Check Balance** - Group 1  
   Displays the user's current balance.

2. **Buy Data** - Group 2  
   Allows the user to purchase data. The balance is updated accordingly.

3. **Buy Airtime** - Group 3  
   Allows the user to purchase airtime. The balance is updated accordingly.

4. **Exit & Invalid Input** - Group 4  
   Handles program exit and displays messages for invalid inputs.

## Instructions for Students

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account.  
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine.  
3. Each group edits **only their assigned section** in `main.py` (look for `pass` comments).  
4. Use **variables, input/output, operators, and conditional statements** to implement your section.  
5. Commit your changes with clear messages, e.g., x : Implemented Buy Data logic 
6. Push your changes to your fork.  
7. Instructor will review and merge each section into the main repository.

## Guidelines

- Do **not** modify other groups' sections.  
- Maintain **proper indentation** for all blocks.  
- Test your code **independently** before submitting.  
- Later, the program will be refactored using **functions and modular programming**.

## Testing the Program

After integration, run:

```bash
python main.py
